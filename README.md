This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This webapp is built with react 15.6.1. Make sure you have node 6 or + and npm installed before running the app.

Steps to run the app:
- download this repo or do `$git clone https://github.com/stanams/leboncoin.git`

- install front dependencies:
`$cd leboncoin && npm install`

- actually run the project:
`$npm start`
You should see a window open at localhost:3000. If you don't, just manually go to http://localhost:3000

`$npm test` then press `a`
